# name_country_game
How many countries do you know?

Hello,

New to this programing world so forgive an missteps during this.  I just completed day 25 of 100 days of python coding challenge with the US State guessing games.  I wanted to take a moment to check my comprehension before moving on because I really struggle with understanding languages. Anyway, that is the "why" I tried my  hand at this project. I decided I wanted to make a country guessing game.  You get a blank map and have to just name all the countries. This was completed in pycham, I moved over all my file so not sure what else needed to come over (1st time uploading to github). 

Explanation of how it works:

There are a total of 5 maps. Africa, East Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and South America.

 There are csvs for each map containing the loc/coordinates for the respective map.

When you start the game, it will ask you what region you would like to play on.  You can select the region by number.  If you enter "exit", that will end the game.  The game does not close automatically, it will just not run.  Once you have chosen a region, you will then get a map and can start guessing the name of the country.  You can exit back to the region selection by entering the keyword "exit".  It will ask you if you want a list of the remaining countries.  Y will create a file in the  "review_items" folder.  After that, it will take you  back to the "region selection" screen.

If you are successful and complete the map, the game will end. I tried to add a message at the top but honestly, I just ran out of steam. I may fix it later.

There is no save function to continue, when you come back you start over.

I have included a folder, "map_answers" that contains all the maps with countries listed for reference.  Also, I added a test file that you can use to just have the game auto pop the name of the countries, should you decide to add more maps. Just follow the template and it should work.

That's it. Enjoy and feel free to leave feed back.

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the images used in the project. I got the maps from

https://allesl.com/printable-blank-maps-coloring-geography/. The game concept is based on a US States game by Sportcle.  I am not creating this for any monetary gain. If you find bugs, by all means shoot me to message and I would love to practice debugging it. However, I do not  guarantee its functionality or upkeep.
